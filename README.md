# SecureNet Analyzer

**SecureNet Analyzer** is a powerful Python-based network traffic monitoring and security tool designed for network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and penetration testers. This tool provides real-time packet capture, live host detection, vulnerability analysis, and secure user authentication to ensure robust network security.

---

## Overview

**SecureNet Analyzer** captures and analyzes network traffic, detects live devices on the network, and helps identify potential vulnerabilities and threats. Leveraging the **Scapy** library for packet crafting, it offers real-time packet analysis, live host detection using ARP requests, custom packet creation, and secure user authentication with SHA-256 hashing for login security.

The tool is ideal for network monitoring, device enumeration, and testing the resilience of your network against various cyber threats.

## Features

- **Packet Capture and Analysis**: Capture and analyze network traffic from any network interface. Extract detailed information including IPs, ports, protocols, and payloads.
- **Live Host Detection**:Detect live devices on your network using ARP requests, mapping their IP, MAC addresses, and NIC vendor names.
- **Packet Creation and Sending**: Craft custom packets and send them to specified addresses for network testing and vulnerability assessment.
- **SHA-256 Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication with password hashing using SHA-256.
- **Data Export**: Export captured packets in **PCAP** and **TXT** formats for further analysis and sharing.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Analyze packets to detect unusual traffic patterns and potential security issues.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3**: Ensure you have Python 3 or later installed.
- **Scapy Library**: This tool requires Scapy for network packet crafting.

## Installation Instructions


2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd SecureNet-Analyzer
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies using pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python Main.py  [option] [arguments]
    ```

### Ensure Privileges:
Since the tool requires access to network interfaces, make sure to run the script with elevated privileges:

- **On Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    sudo python main.py
    ```

- **On Windows:** Ensure you run the command prompt or PowerShell as **Administrator**.

## Usage Examples

The tool operates via the command line interface (CLI). Below are some basic commands and examples:

### Options:
- `-c` or `--capture`: Start packet capture and analysis.
- `-lh` or `--live-host`: Perform live host detection on the network.

### Common Arguments:
- `--i [interface]`: Specify the network interface to capture packets from (e.g., eth0, Wi-Fi).
- `--pc [number]`: Specify the number of packets to capture.
- `--a`: Analyze captured packets in real-time.
- `--s`: Save captured packets.
- `--p [filename]`: Save captured packets in PCAP format.
- `--t [filename]`: Save captured packets in TXT format.
- `--f [filter]`: Define a filter condition (e.g., 'src host 192.168.1.1 and tcp').
- `--ip [IP address]`: Specify an IP address for live host detection.

### Example 1: Start Packet Capture
```bash
python Main.py c --i Wi-Fi --pc 10 --a --s --p captured_traffic.pcap 
```

### Example 2: Live Host Detection
```bash
python Main.py lh --ip 192.168.1.1
```
## Security Considerations

- **Password Storage**: Passwords are securely stored using SHA-256 hashing and never stored in plain text.
- **Network Monitoring**: Use the tool responsibly only on networks where you have explicit permission to capture and analyze traffic. Unauthorized traffic analysis may be illegal and unethical.
- **ARP Spoofing**: The tool uses ARP requests for live host detection, which could trigger ARP spoofing alerts on certain networks. Ensure the tool is used in authorized environments.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Issues**: If you are unable to capture packets, ensure you are running the tool with the appropriate permissions (e.g., using **sudo** on Linux/macOS).
- **Missing Dependencies**: If the tool fails to run due to missing dependencies, verify that you have installed all required packages as outlined in the installation instructions.
- **Network Interface Not Detected**: If the network interface is not detected, verify it is available by running **ifconfig** (Linux/macOS) or **ipconfig** (Windows) to check available interfaces.
